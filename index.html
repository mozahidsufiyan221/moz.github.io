								<p>While working as a Consultant with SCOTTISHPOWER. In my current role, I’m heading up the Bigdata team for petabyte-scale of data. I was also involved with the production of the Invitation To Tender (ITT), selecting the companies to issue the tenders to, using existing systems in my industry such as First Point Assessment, selecting the criteria to assess the bids, and finally in the bid evaluation phase. I was wholly responsible for two fast-track projects, with material, labour cost, and management to the value of £1 million.  I delivered data and analytics including regulatory, customer, operational, financial, environmental, and actionable insight which can enable change. Created Feature Engineering sourcing and preparing data in support of developing analytical models (working with system owners/data architects to source data), wrangle data, feature engineer data, obfuscate data, remediate data quality issues tactically.
Deployed Natural Language Processing (NLP) automatically processing the likelihood of complaint escalation with Machine Learning use of Named-entity recognition (NER) and Topic Modelling techniques within the model.  Established Time Series automated pipeline to forecast daily Call Volumes for Domestic Credit. Successfully implemented an automatic process with improved data inputs to enhance the Call Forecasting accuracy utilizing python’s Prophet library.  Build Wind Farm Computer Vision Turbine Visual Inspection on Drone Imagery technology has been completed using YOLO model processes images using Deep Learning.  Deployed improved warehouse experience using Vision Picking Augmented Reality and SAP for data analysis using Computer Vision Processing inventory. Speech-to-text software has been created using python with TKinter library for customer care to make service better. 
In my current role, I am facing directly customers with a strong technical angle, deep experience in Azure, software and systems architecture, IT infrastructure, security, and other relevant technical concepts. I work closely with customers and prospects to make them successful on the Azure platform, building scalable, fault-tolerant, cost-effective, and secure systems with strategic and tactical issues on MLOps and DataOps Deployments. 
Build and maintain DataOps ETL pipelines/ productionised data flow solutions with system owners/ data owners/ architects to source and land data in approved definitions and formats.  Models, builds, monitors, and optimises logic deployed at scale in live data solutions that support decision-making (AI/ML-enabled) in a domain. Responsible for the logical framework for the solution(s); Liaises with data scientists and business teams to successfully scale new logic; Responsible for the logical integrity of solutions deployed and evaluates the effectiveness and optimisation of solutions for a business opportunity; Recommends and applies corrective actions; Sets parameters and applies model changes.
Created Strategy for ScottishPower Data as an Asset/ Services(DaaA/S) was an enabler for the corporate Strategy.  More specifically, the strategy provides the foundation for the development and implementation of a range of underpinning data and information policies and procedures. To achieve this, we manage our data effectively in integrated data repositories collecting data items only once, maintaining them in only one place, and making them available for use in multiple applications across the business and beyond – providing all customers with “a single version of the truth”.  
I have introduced data catalogs with supporting dictionaries for definitions to help more people understand what data is available, what it means, and how it can be used. We introduce conceptual data maps that are business-friendly with supporting technical maps detailing the data available in logical and physical systems to make it easier and faster to make important connections to data as part of design and development activities. These will also include details of the data's suitability, potential value, and risk assessment for data sharing Open Data. Master data helped to make important logical connections through data, and metadata allowed data more effectively across the data lifecycle.  I made data available in a range of ways. For those interested in citizen data science, we have made no/ low code options available - providing visualization tools that have proven successful in promoting take up within other industries.  This will address potential barriers to participation from stakeholders who want to explore interests in energy and the environment but who many not have advanced data skills. We will also introduce tailored tools to support specific stakeholder needs, such as tools for designing your connection and which make it easier to make informed decisions about individual energy goals and plans. 
We made open data plugs (e.g. API stores) available to support high volume, high-frequency data connections similar to the model for open banking.  In this way, we delivered our commitments as part of the modernizing energy systems initiative.  This will encourage and enable whole systems thinking for consumers and prosumers to access new offerings to reduce their carbon footprint, optimize energy usage and achieve the best value. 
While working as Senior Data Scientist with SWORD VENTURE IT, I developed cloud data pipeline software for classifying document types from unstructured data on web service apps using Machine Learning. Natural Language Processing(NLP) utilized apache TIKA to detects and extracts metadata and text from over a thousand different file types (such as PPT, XLS, and PDF). Optical Character Recognition(OCR) Text Extraction from pdf images and multiple file format binding Apache TIKA with Tesseract-OCR to train python ML model.  Deployed python Data WareHouse(DWH) that includes ETL, Azure SQL database, and data visualization with PowerBI. 
As a Data & Insight Engineer with CAPGEMINI, I worked in a whole Analytical team where knowledge-driven enquires were shared, innovative and thoughtful ideas were encouraged to build confidence and momentum in the team, various processing frameworks were considered in the form of both structured and unstructured data sets and big data technologies were also used as a toolkit to redefine data architectures, thereby building a data pipeline where all key information is stored for further analytical and operational usage.
I have provided data in a ready-to-use form to data scientists who ran algorithms and queries for predictive analytics and Data Mining to produce result-oriented outputs for the clients. In this process, different data mining and machine learning techniques were used to produce a formidable desired output, where every single insight of data is exploited and used to construct a result.  During my organisational role, I have mainly focused on a tactical and operational level to enable the data scientists to focus on the strategic level so an environment could be built which is of utmost professionalism by nature and applauds the role of every individual pragmatically. Therefore providing the value above and beyond single data cleansing and movement.  Responsibilities included maintaining and expanding our AWS infrastructure, and providing mentorship to others on my team.

								<p>Build Capability in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning - Over the course of the year gain programming skills in pyspark or scala on several machine learning algorithms including supervised and unsupervised learning and transferred the knowledge through training graduates and publish the Article for sharing the knowledge.  Developed  Solution Architecture on cloud commodity- Over the course of the year gain an understanding of the Solution architecture where I can design a robust solution for the client by having comparisons on multiple cloud providers and their pros and cons. This has worked towards by attending online courses (e.g my learning, udemy), involvement in Capgemini's smart data analytics slack blogs, and experience on a project exploring the practical use of knowledge learned ad transfer those to peers.
I have also used sophisticated techniques such as Hadoop and Spark to offload storage work of enterprise data warehouse as support of big data analytics, I have used NoSql database and apache spark systems as a component of data workflow, I have worked on data pipelines which provided both batch and real-time processing. In the process pipelines were build which pulled out information from different sources and systems, integrating and consolidating data, and made the model work at scale and lives inside real-world enterprise applications. I have directly worked with the non-technical audience several times to discuss the requirement, engaging with them in a manner to discuss minor details and at times discussed with them analytics infrastructure, databases designs in a lucid manner to make them understand a possible outcome, Thereby formulated queries as per their specific needs, analyzed huge data sets, and helped the data users to get the exact required data.
I was the developer supporting the delivery of the PRAU(Performance Reporting and Analysis Unit) Data Environment for the UK HomeOffice/Border Force. In the role of data engineer, I focused myself on understanding hypothetical design and its explanation within the boundaries of reality, performing Extract Transform and Load(ETL) and data conversion is the key where raw data is simplified by various data warehousing and data mining techniques into an abstract result-oriented reality. Data cleansing through understanding the needs of clients and de-duplication and construction of refined data and extracting meaningful data to satisfy the larger goals was my main objective.
I and the rest of the team both designed and developed a data pipeline to create a Business Intelligence tool, which also comprised a data migration and ETL. One of the notable components was the Database Administration processes around managing and handling PRAU data within the HODAC(Home Office Data Analytics Competencies) and DDaT.   I have worked as a Developer supporting the design and delivery of a Management Information (MI) / Business Intelligence (BI) solution for the PRAU. Development of batched and streaming data pipelines into the Azure Platform as well as discoveries around AWS usage and solutions. Developed PowerBI Dashboard indicators and measures for the greater focus on the operational team within the Home Office and Ministerial-level stakeholders.  Also, I was responsible for Home Office automating and improving infrastructure over to AWS using Vagrant, Ansible, Hashicorp's Terraform, Packer and utilized Cloud Watch to monitor resources such as EC2, CPU memory, Amazon RDS DB services, DynamoDB tables, EBS volumes to deploy as cloud infrastructure as a service(IAAS).  Architected on AWS – designed, built, and deployed multiple applications utilizing AWS stack (VPC Peering, Active Directory, EC2, R53, S3, RDS, IAM, and Redshift), focussing on high-availability, fault tolerance, and auto-scaling for Performance reporting directly via the dashboard to the Ministers within the Home Office were delivered in time.
Created various dashboards for Dixon’s iD Mobile's Customer’s raw data from file formats into DataFrame of python Data Warehouse includes ETL. Used Google Cloud Storage, BigQuery & Data Studio for data warehousing & visualisation. Carried out predictive analytics for churn prediction models that predict customer churn by assessing their propensity of risk to churn.  Services, Account information, Demographic info, are effective at focusing customer retention marketing programs on the subset of the customer base who are most vulnerable to churn also completed on schedule along with Sprint Planning JIRA and Confluence.
While working with Anglian Waters Asset Maintenance Intelligence I delivered Asset Information Models and Digital Twins, PowerBI Dashboards for near real-time IOT sensors representation of physical asset to optimize asset performance, cost, and risk. Used ArcGis and QGIS to locate Asset information like pipeline nodes pump to know exactly where pumps are placed were on time.  Worked on Digital Twin project initiation document which will allow us to optimize how we use the pipeline by enabling holistic decisions derived from the multiple installed sensors/instruments and analysis made possible from the data. 
During my time with BP, I lead the team to deliver results for feasibility Studies. I have worked with other managers to ensure common (both dedicated & non-dedicated) people resources have clear expectations, time availability, identify gaps and recognize resources to fill those gaps. I have engaged myself to develop cost estimates, schedule estimates, monitor, control schedule, and costs for the $500 million Miller Platform work.  
During my MSc in Data Science Thesis I developed Diabetes Prediction Flask App, I used KNN Neighbors Classifier to trained model that is used to predict the positive or negative result. Given a set of inputs are BMI(Body Mass Index), BP(Blood Pressure), Glucose Level, Insulin Level based on these features it predicts whether you have diabetes or not with python flask.  In the other project, I worked on a Patient recognition system for Human Activity Recognition to assist in the prevention, management, and treatment of patients using gyroscopic data utilizing unsupervised learning clustering techniques. 
Recently, I tutored Strathclyde University MSc Students, in which I have used (COVID-19) Forecasting using Random Forest about Machine Learning.  I have acted as a tutor for MSc(Strathclyde University) and several MEng projects(RGU). I also volunteered with the School of Engineering to help facilitate Geospatial Analysis on Covid-19(Day to Day Track) Workshops.  The COVID19 Sentiment Analysis workshops were part of the Engineering Activities which provides first-year students with a clearer understanding of the roles of public perception of panic and encourages them to reflect on what they will gain from data insight.
